Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful. A beautiful permutation of length n is a permutation that has the following property: gcd(1⋅p1,2⋅p2,…,n⋅pn) > 1,
where gcd is the greatest common divisor.

A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. 
For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).

Output
For each test case, print one integer — number of beautiful permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please print the answer modulo 998244353.
